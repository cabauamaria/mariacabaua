        <p>Cybersecurity threats are becoming more prevalent and complex, posing risks to both individuals and companies. One of the most common dangers is phishing, a social engineering attack designed to trick consumers into providing personal information. Phishing attempts frequently mimic reputable sources, making them difficult to detect. Modern browsers, such as Microsoft Edge, offer technologies like Microsoft Defender to help detect and block dangerous websites.</p>

        <p>Data breaches and password theft are major concerns, with hackers targeting businesses to access sensitive information. Password management services in browsers, including security protections like Password Monitor in Microsoft Edge, play a critical role in safeguarding user credentials. Furthermore, malware, including keyloggers, underscores the importance of antivirus software and safe browsing practices.</p>
        
        <p>Ransomware attacks, escalating in recent years, target both individuals and businesses, threatening severe consequences and financial losses. The decentralisation of company networks, especially with the rise of remote work, introduces new cybersecurity challenges. Cybersecurity training for employees is vital for identifying and managing risks effectively.</p>
