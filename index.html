            <h1>Welcome to Maria Cabaua's Introduction to the Internet Final Project </h1>
            <p>The invention of the Internet is a story of evolution, not a single inventor. Its origins can be traced back more than 50 years to the United States, where it first appeared as a government programme during the Cold War. The Internet was originally designed as a tool of communication and data sharing for scientists and researchers, but it has since evolved into an essential component of modern life. Given the Internet's ubiquitous influence in many parts of society today, it is impossible to fathom a world without it.</p>
            
            <p>The establishment of the ARPAnet in the 1960s was a watershed moment in the development of the Internet. Scientists and military specialists worked to address the vulnerability of existing communication systems in the face of prospective attacks. J.C.R. Licklider's vision of a "galactic network" and the subsequent development of packet switching technology helped to create a resilient communication network that could endure disturbances.</p>
            
            <p>Tim Berners-Lee's invention of the World Wide Web in 1991 reshaped the Internet once more. The Web evolved from a simple tool for data sharing to a global repository of information available to everyone with an Internet connection. Subsequent advancements, like as the development of user-friendly browsers like Mosaic and the commercialization of the Internet, hastened its expansion, laying the path for the digital landscape we know today.</p>
